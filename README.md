# Twitter Sentiment Analysis with NLTK and ML GitHub
▪ Developed an ML pipeline using Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and TF-IDF
▪ Assessed the classifiers using F1 scores, OVR ROC-AUC curves for multiclass classification and confusion matrices 
▪ Preprocessed the data using Snowball stemming and lemmatization to normalize words to their canonical form
▪ Scraped over 50 000 Tweets using the Twitter API and cross-referenced a static CSV dataset for accuracy
▪ Utilized serialization to store the dataset into a character stream resulting in a 95% reduction in re-scraping time
